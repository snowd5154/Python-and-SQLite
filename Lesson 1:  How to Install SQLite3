1. Download the SQLite Tools:
Go to the SQLite download page. 
Download the pre-compiled binaries for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). 
Choose the appropriate package based on your system architecture (e.g., x86 or x64). 

2. Extract the Downloaded Files:
Unzip or extract the downloaded file to a directory of your choice.
For example, you could create a folder named sqlite in C:\Program Files on Windows.

3. Add the SQLite Tools Directory to your PATH:
Windows:
Open the System Environment Variables Control Panel shortcut. 
Go to environment variables, choose Path variable, and add the path to the directory where you extracted the SQLite tools (e.g., C:\Program Files\sqlite). 
Close and reopen any command prompts or terminals. 
macOS/Linux:
Edit your shell's configuration file (e.g., ~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc). 
Add a line that sets the PATH environment variable to include the directory containing the SQLite tools. 
Source the configuration file or restart your terminal. 

4. Verify the Installation:
Open a new command prompt or terminal.
Type sqlite3 --version and press Enter.
If SQLite is installed correctly, the version information will be displayed.
